# MashDash

A mod for the game Hollow Knight (v1.5.x).

The player can now use Mothwing and Shade Cloak without limitation. Dashes will come out as quickly as you can mash the button.

Comes with the option to require equipping the Dashmaster charm, in case being able to mash dash without cost is too overpowered.
